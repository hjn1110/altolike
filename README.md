#Altolike 2D rendering experiment

For personal study.

Try to simply restore the lighting effects in Alto's Adventure in 2d way.
 
Real-time color conversion is performed by coloring the grayscale image using ambient light and 2D spotlights.
 
Based on the above, I may try more stylized processing to achieve more effects.
 
completed:

1. Imitate a scene of Alto, and achieve the effect of sunrise and sunset on the screen rendering.
2. Imitate the scenes in "Star Wars: Vision" to achieve an ink-like style rendering and realize the reflection effect of the water surface.

undone:

1. Light block effect.
2. Projection.
3. Fluid physics.
4. Ripples.
